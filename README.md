# React Portfolio

## Description
This portfolio was created using React. This allows for a single-page application. The portfolio has four sections: 
<br/>
The 'About Me' page includes a short bio about the creator of the portfolio. 
<br/>
The 'Portfolio' section is where projects worked on by the creator are showcased. When the github icon is pressed, it links to the repository directly related to the project. When either the deployed link or actual image is clicked, it will redirect to the deployed application. 
<br/>
The 'Contact' page allows a visiting user to send a message to the creator. There are validations on the invdividual boxes, meaning if something is missing, a message will appear letting the user know.
<br/>
The 'Resume' section lists out skills of both front-end and back-end. It also has a link to the actual resume.
